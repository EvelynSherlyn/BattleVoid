## What is BattleVoid?
```bash
BattleVoid is an alternate universe where suddenly, something white and abnormal appears on the earth.
At first, it was just a strange event, but sooner rather than later the world collapsed by it.
"The void", this substance that nobody can explain what it is.
Some people surrender to it, worship it, and even kill for it. Others tries to fight it.

"The void" will be the new evolution for humanity? Or just an abnormality that needs to be killed?

This game is just a short game of some characters simulating their fights in this universe.

## ⌨️ || Gameplay

The gameplay is simple, it's just a point and click to see which player has more luck.

Every character as their own stats; when the battle begins, a number is generated randomly and it adds up to the stat selected in that round.

The first player whose their lifes reaches zero loses.
